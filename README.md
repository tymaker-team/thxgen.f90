# thxgen.f90
You can use your standard Fortran compiler to build this program. Some examples are `gfortran` or `gcc`. Using `gfortran` is recommended.
## Compilation
Run
```console
gfortran thxgen.f95 -o thxgen
```
Although I can't guarantee it'll work - Fortran is all old and creaky.

I'm really excited about this because last time I tried to make a version of thxgen in Fortran, I couldn't do it.
